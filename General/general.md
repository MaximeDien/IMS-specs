Introduction
---

The goal of this document is to provide for Unice an internship management system to simplify the actual process.

Need for Change
---

The initial need came from the current method used to handle students internships. The current process may lead to some problems.


Business Functional Requirements
---

**P1** Current management analysis

**P2** Start working on the IMS

Technical Changes
---

### The current process is :

- Validate the internship with a manager
- After validation, the student can grab his convention
- The convention is filled by the student and the company (3 ex)
- The administration may affect an academic tutor
- Re-enter extracted info to keep tracability on conventions, what is sent, what is here..
- University send filled convention to "Unice"
- Convention come back and his given to the student

### The goal is :

- The student come on the IMS web app, fill his informations
- The university can keep track of everything on some panel, validate details or send errors e-mails
- After convention "ready", printed for signing and sent to Unice
- When conventions come back, University just have to populate changes
- Emails are sent to students when something change 


Deployment Dependencies
---

We need to deploy and provide some documentation / training to avoid any problem.


Upgrade Existing Data Strategy
---

Nothing to keep, or need to ask for current data


Required Tests
---

Test driven development - Everything should be tested before merge on master
Check with other students
Check with administration if everything is "great"


Pending Questions
---

- What to use ? On a technology side ?
- Need to define general UI - for students and administrators
